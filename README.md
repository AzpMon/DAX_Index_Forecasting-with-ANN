# DAX Index Prediction with Neural Networks

***Part of the Inv_Delfin Project: once the project is finished, here will be a link to the complete repository with contributions and code to the other indices considered in the study carried out by the other project participants.***

## Description

Welcome to the DAX Index Prediction repository, dedicated to exploring and developing predictive models for the DAX index using neural network techniques. The DAX index is a blue-chip stock market index representing the 30 (40) largest and most liquid companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Germany. Accurately predicting its movements is essential for investors, traders, and financial analysts operating in Europe and globally.

## Contents

1. **Datasets**: Contains historical datasets of the DAX index. These datasets include daily, weekly, or monthly data, comprising opening, high, low, and closing prices, as well as trading volume and other relevant indicators.

2. **Model Implementations**: Provides implementations of various neural network architectures customized for predicting the DAX index. Models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), and others are explored.

3. **Source Code**: Includes source code in Python (mainly with Pytorch, Pandas, Numpy and Sklearn)  for implementing prediction models and preprocessing the DAX dataset.

4. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on preprocessing steps, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics for predicting the DAX index using neural networks.

5. **Experimental Results**: Presents experimental results obtained by applying different neural network models to the DAX dataset. Results are depicted in graphs, tables, and evaluation metrics for comprehensive comparison.
6. **Other**: Shows data and experiments based on the Source Code for other indexes as the 



## Objective

The primary objective of this repository is to advance research in predictive modeling of the DAX index using neural networks. It aims to provide valuable insights and tools for investors, traders, and financial analysts interested in forecasting stock market trends in Europe. By leveraging neural network techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions for the DAX index, aiding informed decision-making in the financial sector.
